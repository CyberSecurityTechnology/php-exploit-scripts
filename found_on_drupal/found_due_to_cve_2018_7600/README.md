# What is this?

These are some of the examples we found on compromised Drupal installs at [Nucleus](https://www.nucleus.be/en/).

The pattern:

- search.php, dump.php & wp-post.php: same filename everywhere
- favicon_0ac3c0.ico: the `0ac3c0` part is a variable hash every time

These can easily be found & detected through a combination of [Maldet](https://www.rfxn.com/projects/linux-malware-detect/) and regex-searches on functions like `eval`, `gzinflate`, etc.
